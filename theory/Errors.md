* VITE(??)

react-dom-client.development.js:24027 Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.

Check the render method of `Lists`. See https://react.dev/link/warning-keys for more information.


* .jsx???




* 
import './App.css';

function App() {
  
   
   const name = "Siri";
   console.log(name);
   return (
    <>
    
    <h1> WELCOME </h1>
    </>
   );

  
}

export default App;


This is App.js

And when I checked console.. Siri is printed 2 times.. Like How did it print 2 times?? Isn't it just one time?
